2- IBRAHIM Abdelrahman


Kindly find the files in this folder as the following:

1-hm_scara.m: homogenous trasformation matrix+ the jacobian matrix of the scara robot + the singularites "ex1"
2-hm_hexapod.m: homogenous trasformation matrix+ the jacobian matrix of the Hexapod leg model"ex2"
3-Hexapod_leg_modeling.slx: the kinamatic modeling of the hexapod leg on simulink "ex2"
4- Final_report.pdf: our report about the two exercises
5- Illustrating_video.mp4: A short vido illustrating the modeling and the simulation of the scara robot and the hexapod leg as well as discussing the results 

Thank you
