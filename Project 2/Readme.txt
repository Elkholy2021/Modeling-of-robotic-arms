Bonjour!

This work was done by:

1- ELKHOLY Hassan
2- IBRAHIM Abdelrahman


Kindly find the files in this folder as the following:

A- 3 DOF Folder "Only considering the first three degrees of freedmom
	1-hm_puma.m: homogenous trasformation matrix+ the jacobian matrix of the PUMA 560 robot for the first 3 joints
	2-RobotPUMA560.slx:the kinamatic modeling of the PUMA 560 robot on simulink 

B- 5 DOF Folder "considering all the degrees of freedom
	1- Puma560_Jacobian: homogenous trasformation matrix+ the jacobian matrix of the PUMA 560 robot for all the 5 joints
	2-Five_DOFs.slx:the kinamatic modeling of the PUMA 560 robot on simulink considering all the joints
	3- Modified stl files, we modified the the frames in the stl files using solidworks so that the new frames would comply with the frames in the drawing
	Kindly note that because the jacobian of the 5 joints is too large, we did not add in the report but you can check it by running Puma560_Jacobian.m
C-Final_report.pdf: our report about the PUMA 560 robot exercise

Thank you
